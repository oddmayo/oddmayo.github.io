Hi, I'm Camilo Mayorquín. I'm an economist who has never practiced my profession. I discovered data science and artificial intelligence just before graduating and never looked back. I call myself a data scientist.

I have a cat named Walter, and I care about him very much.

I have eight years of experience working on projects related to machine learning, natural language processing, geography, scraping, and, most recently, GenAI. I think I was at my prime back in 2019 when I won various hackathons and was eager to learn. After the 2020 pandemic, I went through life on autopilot.

Things have changed. This blog will help me stop hesitating about studying difficult subjects. Not only that, but I also have many things I want to study and improve upon.

I don't expect many people to read this blog, but if even one person finds it helpful, interesting, inspiring, or fun, that would be more than enough for me.
