Hi, my name is Camilo Mayorquín, I'm an Economist that has never practiced his profession. I discovered the data science and artificial intelligence topics just before graduating, and never looked back. I call myself a Data Scientist.

I have a cat named Walter, I care a lot about him.

I have 8 years of experience working in projects about machine learning, natural language processing, geography, scraping, and recently GenAI. I think my prime was back in the year 2019 when I won various hackatons and was very hungry of learning, after the 2020 pandemic I sort of went about life on autopilot.

But things have changed, this blog will be a tool for myself to tackle all sorts of things I've been afraid of studying because I considered them difficult. But not just that, I have a lot of things I want to study and be better at.

I don't expect many people to read this, but if even just one person finds all this garble helpful, interesting, inspiring or fun, I'd die a happy wannabe blogger.
